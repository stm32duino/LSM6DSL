# LSM6DSL
Arduino library to support the LSM6DSL 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope

## API

This sensor uses I2C or SPI to communicate.
For I2C it is then required to create a TwoWire interface before accessing to the sensors:  

    TwoWire dev_i2c(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL);  
    dev_i2c.begin();

For SPI it is then required to create a SPI interface before accessing to the sensors:  

    SPIClass dev_spi(SPI_MOSI, SPI_MISO, SPI_SCK);  
    dev_spi.begin();

An instance can be created and enabled when the I2C bus is used following the procedure below:  

    LSM6DSLSensor AccGyr(&dev_i2c);
    AccGyr.begin();
    AccGyr.Enable_X();  
    AccGyr.Enable_G();

An instance can be created and enabled when the SPI bus is used following the procedure below:  

    LSM6DSLSensor AccGyr(&dev_spi, CS_PIN);
    AccGyr.begin();	
    AccGyr.Enable_X();  
    AccGyr.Enable_G();

The access to the sensor values is done as explained below:  

  Read accelerometer and gyroscope.

    int32_t accelerometer[3];
    int32_t gyroscope[3];
    AccGyr.Get_X_Axes(accelerometer);  
    AccGyr.Get_G_Axes(gyroscope);
