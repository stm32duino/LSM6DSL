 * @brief   Arduino test application for the STMicrolectronics STM32 IOT Discovery Kit.
 *          MEMS Inertial and Environmental sensor expansion board.
 *          This application detects wake up event through the LSM6DSL sensor.
 *          This application makes use of C++ classes obtained from the C
 *          components' drivers.
